> HOW TO RUN?

**Necessary environment for the project**

oracle jdk 8

mysql 5.7

redis 5.X

minio or cloud storage that supports S3 protocol

maven 3.6.3 3.8.X

nodejs >= 12 < 18

npm 6.X 8.X

- Solana-chain

  Running the node service is very easy. You only need to execute `npm i`, and then execute `npm run dev` to start the service.

- Solana-tool

  Similarly, you must first execute `npm i`, and then execute `node index.js` to start the service. 
  
  You can also use `pm2 start index.js --name solana-chain` to mount the background process for execution.

- Game backend

   - jar

     You need to execute `run.sh start` on the linux system,
     
     You can also execute `run.sh stop` or `run.sh` status to better control the running of the `metabot-admin.jar`.

     The default port for startup is 8080

   - mysql/redis
     
     The user must be `root` and the password is empty

     You need to create a mysql database named `xbot`, use *utf8mb4* as the character set, and then import `metabot_mysql.sql` into the database

   - nginx

     `nginx.conf` implements the reverse proxy of the game management background

   - minio

     ```bash
     wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
   
     chmod +x minio
   
     MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 nohup ./minio server --config-dir ./config --console-address ":9001" /mnt/data > ./logs/minio.log 2>&1 &#
     ```

- Game management platform

  If you have configured the local nginx environment, you can access the game management platform.
